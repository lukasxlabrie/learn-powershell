## PowerShell Pipelines and Data Export

PowerShell connects commands using a **pipeline**, which allows one command to pass its output to another. This is done using the **pipe symbol `|`**, letting the second command process the output of the first.

### ðŸ”¹ Pipelining Example

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
```

This example:

* Gets all running processes.
* Sorts them by CPU usage (highest first).
* Selects the top 5.

### ðŸ”¹ Exporting Data in PowerShell

PowerShell supports exporting data to **multiple useful formats**, including:

* **TXT**: Plain text
* **CSV**: Comma-separated values (Excel-friendly)
* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation (widely used in APIs)
* **XML**: Extensible Markup Language (used in config and data files)

These formats are helpful when exporting data from sources like **Azure Active Directory** or **cloud storage**.

#### Examples:

```powershell
Get-Process | Export-Csv -Path "Processes.csv" -NoTypeInformation
Get-Command | Out-File -FilePath "Commands.txt"
```

### ðŸ”¹ Practice with Built-In Commands

To understand piping, try it out using these common commands:

| Cmdlet                  | Alias |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| `Get-Process`           | `gps` |
| `Get-Command`           | `gcm` |
| `Get-History -Count 10` | `h`   |

You can then pipe these into formatters or exporters:

```powershell
gps | Format-Table -AutoSize
gcm | Export-Csv -Path "commands.csv" -NoTypeInformation
h | Out-File -FilePath "history.txt"
```
