Mastering the help system is the key to becoming a PowerShell expert
The help system is vital to building PowerShell skills
It helps identify which commands to use based on the situation
Shows how to properly run commands, which helps when troubleshooting errors
Explains how commands relate to each other

Going forward, youâ€™ll need to use the help system to complete exercises
Always read the help section for each command to get used to it
Also use help to learn the correct syntax

If local help is not installed, update it using:
`Update-Help`
Run this about once a month to stay current
To save a local copy of the help files:
`Save-Help`

To search help:
`help <search term>`
Use Tab to autofill, press Tab twice to browse more options
Use Q to quit out of help view

`Get-Help` is the actual cmdlet
