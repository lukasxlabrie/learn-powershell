# PowerShell Help Updater with Error Bypass

## Error Code

When running PowerShell's `Update-Help` command, you might see this frustrating error:

"Update-Help: Failed to update Help for the module(s) 'ConfigDefenderPerformance' with UI culture(s) {en-US} : One or more errors occurred. (Response status code does not indicate success: 404 (The requested content does not exist.).)."


Some modules—especially ones built into Windows or not fully documented—don't have help content online. PowerShell will still try to fetch it and spit out these errors.

## This script will allow help to update sucessfully 

`update-help-bypass.ps1` updates all available help content _while skipping over the broken ones

Here's what it does:

- Sets the UI culture to `en-US` explicitly.
- Silently skips any module help updates that fail.
- Outputs clear status messages.

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the script.
