Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches – Study Log

Welcome! This repository documents my journey through "Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches" by Don Jones and Jeffrey Hicks. 

My goal is to build a strong foundation in PowerShell by working through the book one chapter (or "lunch") at a time, sharing notes, scripts, and takeaways as I go.

"Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches" is designed for busy IT professionals who want to get up to speed with PowerShell through practical, daily lessons—no prior scripting experience needed.

Authors: Don Jones & Jeffrey Hicks
Focus: Task automation, system administration, command-line proficiency

.gitignore Overview

This repo includes a .gitignore file to keep the version history clean and relevant. It excludes:

- Temporary or backup files (*.tmp, *.bak)
- PowerShell history (ConsoleHost_history.txt)
- System artifacts (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- Editor-specific folders (.vscode/)
- Log or debugging output (*.log)

This helps ensure only meaningful scripts and notes are committed to version control.

Goals

- Complete all 30 lunches in 30–45 days
- Document concepts in plain language with working examples
- Build a reusable PowerShell knowledge base for future reference
- Share progress with others learning PowerShell
